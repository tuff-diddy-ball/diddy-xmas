December 5
My Spotify playlist got hacked. Every Christmas song was remixed with Diddy's beats: "Jingle Bells" became "Jingle Balls,"
and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" had ad-libs about glowing from baby oil rubs. I deleted the app,
but it auto-reinstalled overnight with a notification: "Can't stop the holiday groove. 🎅🏾"

December 6
A drone buzzed my window at dawn, dropping a package labeled "St. Nick's Secret Stash."
Inside: a pair of fuzzy handcuffs shaped like reindeer antlers and a vial of shimmering lotion. Note attached:
"For those cold winter nights. Warm up with me." I buried it in the backyard, but now the squirrels are acting extra frisky.

My Uber Eats driver showed up in a full elf costume and refused to hand over my McDonald's until I did the “Diddy bop” on the porch.
He filmed it. It has 3.2 million views on TikTok. The caption: “He almost made it to Christmas pure 😈🎄.”
</p>
<p>
December 8
Checked my email-spam folder full of invites to a "Freaky Fireplace Chat" Zoom with Diddy.
The preview: Him lounging by a fire in nothing but stockings, promising "stocking stuffers you'll never forget."
I marked it as phishing, but my computer started playing "Mo Money Mo Problems" on loop.
</p>

Neighbors complained about strange lights from my roof. Climbed up to find a neon sign: "Diddy's North Pole Annex - Enter if You Dare."
It was wired to my electricity. Called an electrician; he arrived in a Bad Boy Records hoodie and said, "Boss's orders-it's staying till New Year's."

I got invited to a “Secret Santa Gift Exchange” at a Miami mansion. The RSVP link just said “Wear something easy to remove.”
I didnt go. Instead I stayed home and watched Elf on mute while clutching a baseball bat. At 2 a.m. someone slid an envelope under my door.
Inside: a single ribbon, a hotel keycard to the Setai, and a note that read, “You can run but you can't hide from Krampus Diddy.”
</p>
<p>
December 11
My phone's Siri started responding in Diddy's voice: "What can I help you with, playa? Want directions to the nearest freak-off?"
I factory reset it, but the wallpaper changed to him as an elf, winking with the caption: "I've got my eye on you this holiday season."
</p>

December 12
A delivery guy in a sleigh-themed truck dropped off a massive fruitcake. Slicing it open revealed a hidden compartment with mini Cîroc bottles and a
USB drive labeled "Private Holiday Footage." I smashed it with a hammer. The cake was still glistening suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
December 13
Woke to my car covered in fake snow-except it was shredded tinsel mixed with oil, making it impossible to drive without slipping.
Hood ornament replaced with a tiny Diddy figurine holding a mistletoe. Tow truck driver laughed: "Looks like you've been Diddy'd."
</p>

My mom called. “Sweetie, Sean Combs sent the family a Christmas ham. It's… shaped weird. And it's glistening.”
I told her to throw it away. She said, “But it came with a $500 gift card to BabyOil.Com!”
I hung up and started pricing one-way tickets to Antarctica.
</p>

December 15
Billboard ad on my commute route changed overnight: My face photoshopped next to Diddy in Santa outfits, with "Join the Freaky Festive Duo!"
I called the company; they said it was a "generous anonymous donation." Traffic slowed as people pointed and laughed.

My gym locker had a surprise: A towel monogrammed "Puff's Personal Rubdown" and a locker note: "Sweat it out, then oil it up.
Meet me in the sauna for holiday gains." I switched gyms, but the new one had his music on every speaker.
</p>

December 17
A flash mob appeared at my office holiday party, dancing to "Bad Boy for Life" with moves that got increasingly suggestive.
The leader handed me a candy cane mic and said, "Your turn to drop a verse about dodging the Diddy Claus." I quit on the spot.
</p>

December 18
A choir showed up caroling outside my house. Beautiful voices. All classics: “Deck the Halls,” “Silent Night,” and then…
a 10-minute remix of “I'll Be Missing You” but the lyrics were “I'll Be Diddling You.”
Half the choir was wearing ski masks. One of them had a tattoo that said “No Diddy.” I think he was trying to warn me.
</p>
<p>
December 19
My streaming service recommended a "personalized holiday movie marathon." First up: A deepfake of me in "Home Alone,"
but instead of burglars, it's Diddy trying to break in with gifts of oil and invites. I canceled my subscription;
they offered a free month "courtesy of Bad Boy Entertainment."
</p>
<p>
December 20
Went for a jog; a limo pulled up blasting Christmas hip-hop. Window rolled down-diddy's hologram projection:
"Hop in, we're caroling in style. First stop: My yacht for eggnog shots." I sprinted the other way, now paranoid of every black car.
</p>

I made the mistake of going to the mall. Walking past the Santa photo booth, I saw him. Red velvet suit unbuttoned to the navel,
gold chains over white fur trim, sunglasses indoors. A sign read: “Pictures with BAD BOY SANTA - $50 (oil included).”
The line was 90% influencers. One guy in front of me whispered, “Bro, if he asks you to sit on his lap, just say you're Jewish.”
</p>
<p>
December 22
My thermostat app glitched, cranking the heat to 85°F. Notification: "Getting you warmed up for the holidays. - P.D."
Then the vents started pumping out a faint baby oil mist. I unplugged everything and slept in the garage with windows open.
</p>
<p>
December 23
A parade of food trucks parked outside, offering "Diddy's Festive Feasts" for free: Turkey legs basted in oil, pies with "freaky fillings."
The drivers chanted my name until I came out. I grabbed a sample and ran-tasted like regret and Cîroc.
</p>
<p>
December 24
Christmas Eve. I barricaded the doors, turned off all the lights, and hid in the basement with a flashlight and a rosary
I stole from my grandma in 2003. At 11:59 p.m. the power went out. Then the music started. “Last Night” blasting at concert volume.
Through the window I saw colored lights strobing across the snow. A full-on silent disco rave was happening in my yard.
Diddy was in the middle, shirtless under an open Santa coat, spinning fire poi made of burning $100 bills.
He locked eyes with me through the glass and mouthed: “One more day.”
</p>
<p>
December 25
I woke up at noon. The house was silent. No Diddy. No rave. No oiled-up elves.
Just a single gift under my tree. Perfectly wrapped in black paper with a red bow.
I waited until sunset, then opened it with barbecue tongs from six feet away.
Inside: a bottle of baby oil… and a note.
“Merry Christmas. You win this year.
But next December? I'm putting you on the permanent NICE list.
- Love, Puff Claus ♡”
I immediately booked a church retreat for all of December 2026.
They said confession is anonymous.
We'll see about that.
