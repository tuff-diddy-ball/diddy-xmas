December 3
that candy was so bad it makes you sick you check your phone to see the time and notice a notification
its Ring camera it caught a black Sprinter van peeling out at 3:00 a.m.
you go out to investegate and see A 12-foot inflatable Santa appeared on your lawn overnight.
Except the face is Diddy. And it's wearing assless red velvet pants.
